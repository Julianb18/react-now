# react-now (micro-application)

This is my submission of the Vue.js challenge.

#### I used two open source plugins:
[vimeo/player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vimeo/player) - which I used to display the video.
also
[vue-window-size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-window-size) - which I used to get the window size of the app.

```
